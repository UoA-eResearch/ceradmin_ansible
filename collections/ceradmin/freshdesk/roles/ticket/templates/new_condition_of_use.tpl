    Dear {{first_name}},
    <br/><br/>
    Thanks for putting in a new Nectar allocation request, or an amendment request for an existing Nectar allocation
    (<i>{{project_name}}</i>).
    <br/><br/>
    Cyber security is a serious concern for the University.
    <br/>
    You might have heard about the recent Log4Shell vulnerability, which high-lighted the risk
    to the University's computers. Compromised computers cause confidential data to be stolen,
    and are used to attack other machines.
    <br/>
    Unfortunately, this is not an abstract but a rather concrete risk.
    <br/><br/>
    So even though Nectar is self-service, we need to be pro-active to ensure virtual machines
    on Nectar are up-to-date, in particular those that open up ports to the world.
    </br/><br/>
    A new condition of use of Nectar at the University of Auckland is the ability for operational
    staff at the Centre for eResearch to have access to your virtual machines, and to allow for
    the installation of a vulnerability detection tool.
    <br/><br/>
    Please reply to acknowledge this condition of use, and we will be happy to approve your
    allocation request.
    <br/><br/>

    Many thanks,<br/>
    Nectar@Auckland team
    <br/>
